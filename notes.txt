-Transaction signatures ensure authenticity of transactions

-Signatures are generated from private keys

-Public keys and addresses are generated from private keys

-Private keys have to be kept safe under under all circumstances

-Public keys are longer versions of the address

***Cryptographic Hashing***

input --> function --> digest

-Hashing is the mathematical foundation of blockchains

Blocks have hashes of previous Blocks(they are chained together)

-Changing information in a previous block changes all blocks thereafter

*** smart contract ***

- a piece of code running on the blockchain

- state change happens through transactions

*** Solidity ***

the most popular -- compared to JS

the smart contracts are running on the blockchain

they are turing complete

the structure looks familiar


*** Ethereum Network ***

All: Ethereum Protocal
-same way of storing data
-same way of accessing data

Live Network
-Real Money. Why? We agreed upon it.

Test Networks
-Test smart contracts
-Test Protocal updates

Private Networks
-run your own blockchain
