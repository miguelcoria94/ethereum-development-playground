-Transaction signatures ensure authenticity of transactions

-Signatures are generated from private keys

-Public keys and addresses are generated from private keys

-Private keys have to be kept safe under under all circumstances

-Public keys are longer versions of the address

input --> function --> digest

-Hashing is the mathematical foundation of blockchains

Blocks have hashes of previous Blocks(they are chained together)

-Changing information in a previous block changes all blocks thereafter
